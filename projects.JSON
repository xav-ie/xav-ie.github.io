The Dichopter Project allows people to expolore 3D vision and perception of other physics simulations. I enjoyed this project because it required me to learn how to optimize web pages when dealing with lots of content. ",

I score the rockets based on how fit they are, and the goal is to hit the red dot in the fastest time possible. The fittest rockets are allowed to generate more children with a small amount of mutation so that the rockets may evolve to be faster. This is from a YouTube tutorial by Dan Shiffman. ",
