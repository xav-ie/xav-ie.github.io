Packed with protein, these cookies definitely won't leave you hungry although you may crave for more. Relish this chocolatey snack that has a satisfying crunch. These are so simple to make and no baking is required! Savor this delicious, chocolatey, scrumptious cookie.

Estimated Cook Time: 5 Minutes

Ingredients Needed:
- 1 cup of peanut butter
- 2 scoops of protein powder
- 1 cup of rolled oats
- 1/4 cup of of honey
- Other mix-ins
  -Granola

Steps:
1) Combine the peanut butter, honey, and protein mix into a bowl.
2) Fold in the oats. (itâ€™s okay to use your hands!)
3) Add the mix-ins, and more oats if a dryer cookie is desired.
4) Roll into bite-size balls and flatten.

Tips: I advise to you add a little more oats than you think, because as you mix them in, you will notice that they get well saturated and almost dissolve. Also, I think it would be interesting to try other mix-ins not mentioned here, like dried banana chip pieces or even peanuts. Be sure to experiment with the other protein powders too.
