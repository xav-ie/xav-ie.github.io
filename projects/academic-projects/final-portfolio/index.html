                    <div class="col s12">
                        <p>For my Public Intellectual assignment, I decided to engage with Hope Ruse, a strong-
                            willed liberal friend of mine. She, in almost every sense of the word, belongs to and is an
                            an advocate of the liberal party and its values. Part of this, is a view that sex in society
                            can be positive and “hooking up” is a great thing. This is not me putting words in her
                            mouth. In fact, she can be quoted saying, “Everyone, or at least most people, want sex.
                            Therefore, if
                            they are consenting, then how can that not be good?” I can see this argument. Sex is
                            typically seen as a positive experience. Many movies and other works depict the losing of
                            virginity as something as a coming of age. What I find problematic and posed to Hope is
                            that most of these encounters where the hook ups occur do not end up really improving the
                            lives of the people engaging in the hookup. In fact, as I told Hope, most of these
                            experiences these people rate as being negative. There is significant evidence saying that
                            people are not enjoying these experiences. She told me that she simply did not believe that.
                            Was my
                            evidence too weak? What had I done wrong? I tried to emphasize that I am not trying to say
                            no one should ever have sex. I am just trying to say that hook up culture has some strange
                            effects that should be considered if one were to hook up. These facts themselves put the
                            actor in the situation to be more likely not to hookup (probably) but I could not understand
                            why I was being met with such resistance. I brought up the additional point that, if most of
                            these people are not enjoying their experiences, then they probably engaged in an act that
                            they most likely did not agree to during the encounter. The lack of communication is
                            troubling and can coerce participants into things they normally would never had originally
                            agreed to. Hope was able to see this point, but she still held that these people were adults
                            and she still did not understand why objectifying people is such a bad thing, especially
                            when the act is mutual. This is something I never really considered before. I think this is
                            something also special to sex and hooking up alone. I cannot think of any other acts in
                            which both parties seem to be using each other as objects in such a mutual way. Perhaps,
                            this is something that people in society simply are okay with, something they are willing to
                            will to become a universal maxim. When I tried coming up with an answer to “What is so
                            wrong with people objectifying others?” I could muster anything but, “Well, Kantianism
                            says that using people as mere objects is one of the most evil things one can do”. However,
                            upon further reflection, I am not sure this statement captures what Kant really meant. In
                            sex, people often use each other as objects, that is simply as a fact. In this case, the
                            people might not be using each other as mere objects, they pass the Kantian test. Another
                            instance, two (or more) people use each other as mere objects in the sex act. In the ideal
                            situation
                            (which is unlikely), they both enjoy it and mutually agreed to use each other this way. Is
                            this “will”-able? Is this allowed to become a universal maxim? I am not sure. I would like
                            to say it already is, but something to me still does not feel right. All the work I did
                            proving that hook-up culture is overall not a good idea still sits with me and I think it
                            might be
                            because this is (hookup culture), a bad maxim that society allowed. If we live in a society
                            like this, how, then, can we ever hope to change it? Do we even need to? I am unsure.
