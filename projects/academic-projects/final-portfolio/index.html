                    <div class="col s12 m10">
                        <p>Welcome to my writing portfolio for the course WR150: Applied Ethics in America Today. Below, you will find the work I have done throughout the semester for this class along with a table of contents above. But first, I want to
                            analyze my growth over the semester. Entering the class, I honestly had no real grasp on what philosophy was. However, I was able to recognize the propositional logic being used from a computer science course I was taking and
                            quickly became excited. I learned on a deeper level about the connections propositional logic had to the real world and how I can use it to form arguments. Soon, we moved onto reading about moral frameworks and began discussing
                            them in class. Eventually, the class consisted mostly of discussions and readings. One of the last things we did was teach the class about our topic and try to convince them of our argument for our final paper. In this introductory
                            essay, I want to walk through my experiences in the class and how each one has strengthened me as a writer.</p>
                        <p>WR150 started at a fast pace as we went through what my professor called a “Philosophy Bootcamp.” During this, we had longer readings designed to cover more basic concepts and ideas about philosophy itself. We trained on how to
                            recognize some basic arguments in the form of propositional logic, debated various frameworks’ practicality, and battled these frameworks against each other in class. If it is unclear how my writing improved, let me highlight
                            it now. With these various in-class discussions, not only was I engaged and enticed to learn more about the subject, but I was also learning more about what a basic argument looks like. </p>
                        <p>As a side note, something that I really enjoyed about the course was how relevant it was to my other courses. I not only was mastering the basics concepts of reasoning and argumentation, but also picking up the formatting of a
                            humanities essay and how to write one. These lessons proved very useful in the other class I was taking, Introduction to Religion. The propositional logic I was absorbing in my computer science course also married nicely with
                            the class and inspired me. </p>
                        <p>As we got farther into the course, we were tasked to write an argument against ourselves for our Devil’s Advocate assignment. We were allowed to have a first thought on a subject, but we had to spend most of our time crafting our
                            opponent’s argument. In the essay, I argued for hedonism even though I believed the idea was false. I set up several counterexamples and went to great lengths to defend my opponent. I learned that making a great argument means
                            that you cannot think one-sidedly, that you really must take into account your opponent’s views and take them seriously. If you do not take your opponent’s views seriously, then your argument is weak, it only exists to further
                            the ideas of others who think similarly. The whole point of arguing is to shift an opponent’s perspective and learning to understand them on a deeper level has tremendously helped improve my argumentation skills. </p>
                        <p>Next, we began discussing in class real-world issues about ethics in America. This was my favorite part in the class. I began venturing into research about philosophy at Boston University (BU) and learned that we had relevant thinkers
                            such as Noam Chomsky battle out with former BU President John Silber. I also heard Yosef Abramowitz speak when he came back to visit BU, who was fighting for what he thought was morally right when he founded the divestment
                            movement against apartheid at BU when he was an undergraduate. I realized that real-life philosophy happens every day and what we were discussing in class was not just class-talk if we took it seriously enough. I learned most
                            from these in-class discussions that we must prepare to defend our ideas against all kinds of opponents and, therefore, it forced me to think more critically about what kind of argument I was making.</p>
                        <p>Nearing the end of our semester, it was now time for us to present to the class a proposal for our paper and teach them more about the topic we researched. We first did a curatorial write-up recapping a conversation we had with
                            someone outside of class. I polished up my handout after this and rather cockily assumed I would be able to just communicate everything I had learned in the research I had done for my essay to the class with just the handout.
                            I ultimately failed in even getting to the main point of my argument. The topic, hookup culture, even though it was specific, was still too broad for a philosophically grounded debate. I ended up spending most of my time teaching
                            the class the basics of when consent is violated. I learned that, to have effective debates, specificity is imperative. I had a general idea and I thought I was specific. I learned from this experience that the more specific
                            you are, the greater your argument will be. </p>
                        <p>Finally, we are concluding the semester with our final paper, and I am glad for all the lessons I learned along the way, as I use all of them in my final essay. Overall, I have learned how to improve my skills as a writer by learning
                            strategies to more clearly communicate my ideas. I am walking away from this class as a stronger writer.</p>

                        <h4>Final Draft: "On-Demand Happiness: Problems with Psychological Hedonism and Kantianism as an Alternative"</h4>
                        <p>In today’s society where pleasure “on-demand” is becoming ever accessible through means such as Netflix and Hulu, it is not far-reaching to imagine another society where the movies we watch will be, instead, simulations of our
                            own lives. These simulations, as Robert Nozick poses in his thought experiment, “The Experience Machine”<sup>1</sup>, could be generated to fulfill our deepest desires and allow us to live a “better” life than our own. Would
                            you use the experience machine? Many, including myself, would be hesitant to say yes although it may be unclear as to why. Nozick’s thought experiment is a rebuttal against psychological hedonism, the claim that humans are
                            solely motivated by pleasure. In what follows, I lay out some of the arguments that psychological hedonism gives, highlight the core issues psychological hedonism has, and finally show why it cannot be accepted and push for
                            Kantianism, a less flawed philosophy.</p>
                        <p>My initial view on psychological hedonism is that it is false. I believe that humans are motivated by far more than just pleasure. Religion is a popular source of greater meaning for many. Following some reading, however, it became
                            clear to me that the existence and validity of religion itself can be questioned. According to Karl Marx<sup>2</sup>, religion is the “opium of the people”. He believes it is a delusion that mankind created as a means to accept
                            the unhappiness within ourselves. Some could argue that we did not create religion, yet the problem with that is that Divine Command Theory<sup>3</sup> cannot be true. If mankind is motivated by more than simple pleasure, then,
                            some will argue, he must also be motivated by religion. If mankind truly was motivated by religion, then this is somewhat problematic. Suppose mankind created religion, then we would not actually be motivated by religion; rather,
                            he would be motivated by the principles we used when creating the religion. If we argue that mankind did not create religion, then Divine Command Theory must be true. Divine Command Theory is false, proving that mankind simply
                            cannot be motivated by religion. Mankind can still be motivated by the practices of religion, perhaps it gives them a sense of balance and pleasure in their lives, but this is not religion. Mankind must be motivated by pleasure
                            if we followed this line of thinking. </p>
                        <p>However, this argument against religion as a motivator can be qualified; as mentioned earlier, if mankind created religion, then mankind must be motivated by those principles used to create the religion. What could be these principles?
                            Sigmund Freud would claim that the principle is an ‘oceanic’ connectedness<sup>4</sup>. It is a feeling that you are part of a greater “plan” and you feel some “sense of purpose”. Freud explains, however, that this ‘oceanic’
                            feeling is really just a psychological illusion, an effect of having an “ego”. He explains that, when we are born, we are not autonomous, we have no sense of self, and develop this feeling of autonomy later in life through
                            the development of one’s ego. The feelings and ‘senses’ you had before developing your ego is this ‘oceanic’ feeling. Some people, claims Freud, simply do not lose this feeling. Even if this ‘oceanic’ feeling idea were true
                            and one would be willing to accept the idea that humans have egos, it is doubtful that it is what motivates us and still does not clearly connect to religion. Freud gives two alternate theories as to what we could be motivated
                            by. The first one centers on our obsession with objects, order and everything around us being in “the right place”. It is based on the idea that mankind draws inspiration of organization from nature and seeks to replicate it.
                            Thus, what motivates us is drawn from that inspiration. A very interesting idea, but it should be pointed out that this motivation is connected to and brings us pleasure. Freud also points out that we may actually be motivated
                            by love and love of all things. He claims that, if mankind is motivated by more than just pleasure, then mankind must also be motivated by love. This appears plausible, as there are many things you do out of love, where you
                            do not necessarily derive pleasure. If mankind is motivated by love, then mankind will do actions out of love. If mankind does actions out of love, then mankind is not motivated by pleasure to do those actions. However, the
                            problem many have with Freud’s theory is that all love, or actions of love, involve pleasure, intentional or not. They argue that humans simply pretend that these actions do not bring them pleasure, but they really do. Whether
                            it is short term or long term, these actions of love are undeniably “pleasurable” in some sense of the word. Therefore, mankind is really motivated by pleasure and mankind is not motivated by love. We are motivated by nothing
                            more than just pleasure.</p>
                        <p>Some may still be led to believe that the argument that deals with love as a motivator is not strong because it still leaves many other motivations other than pleasure untouched. There are countless motivations that one could bring
                            up that are not, or at least appear to not be pleasure. Initially, this appears to be true, maybe there is a motivation out there other than pleasure; but, a psychological hedonist will ultimately conclude all actions are connected
                            somehow, someway to pleasure. There may be higher forms of motivations, such as love, yet one still derives pleasure from them. The objection of love may seem weak, but it reveals that something that is supposed to be one of
                            the most altruistic motivations is, in actuality, one of pleasure. Put simply, all motivations are connected to pleasure, be it rational or irrational. Love, some naysayers will argue, is irrational, therefore it cannot be
                            motivated by pleasure. Pleasure, too, can be irrational, it is connected to love, after all. Even still, others will say avoidance of pain is not connected to pleasure. Still, this is simply another form of pleasure. Pleasure
                            is a binary that cannot be escaped and is what defines all of our motivations. </p>
                        <p>While it is true that pleasure is involved in all of our decisions, a major problem with psychological hedonism is that it too quickly points out that, if pleasure is involved in an action, then the action must be motivated by
                            pleasure. Its conclusion is difficult to refute, yet, I still have reservations. I don’t feel satisfied that humans are merely seeking pleasure and that is the root of all of our motivations. Otherwise, as Nozick pointed out,
                            we would all use the experience machine. If psychological hedonism was supposed to be true, we would see others simply filling their deepest and carnal desires all the time. A psychological hedonist could object to this, pointing
                            out that this does not bring ultimate pleasure, but temporary, so this argument is untrue. Immanuel Kant, an exceptional philosopher, pointed out that what motivates us, could be the initial thought that we had, the initial
                            imperative; and, while pleasure could be a motivator, it is not initially what pushed us to do an action. When a firefighter runs into a building to save someone, his first thought is definitely not the pleasure he is going
                            to get from saving them, rather, it is something else. Kant had his own ideas of what this could be and it is a major flaw in the argument against psychological hedonism that I am making. Defining the motivation is a very difficult
                            task and, from an epistemic standpoint, the analysis of what motivates us may require an impossible introspection of ourselves. However, psychological hedonism is not without its own problems. The claim that pleasure drives
                            all actions, as mentioned earlier could still lead to a questionable, even objectionable, society that is led only by carnal and sexual desire. Additionally, dismissing all forms of motivation other than pleasure to really
                            be just pleasure is biased and myopic. How could one have the capacity to know for certain that all motivations are merely pleasure? The problems that arise out of adopting psychological hedonism are not only problematic, but
                            unacceptable, and must be remedied. If the psychological hedonist could satisfactorily solve the problems it has with its philosophy, I would accept it. A Kantian view on what motivates us, however, is more plausible. It does
                            have problems, yet the assuming nature of psychological hedonism is more flawed. It may be impossible to decisively prove what motivates humans, and a Kantian view can accept this. There are some who may not be satisfied not
                            knowing what motivates us, but it really may be impossible to prove and I am willing to accept that.</p>

                        <h3>Kant in America: Hook Up Culture and Stormy Daniels</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col s12 m10">
                        <p><em>The Issue:</em> The Stormy-Daniels-Donald Trump sex scandal is a recently “settled” sexual (and political) scandal involving the pornstar Stormy Daniels, Donald Trump, and Michael Cohen. The political history of the scandal
                            is complicated and elaborate, involving much naysaying and political deliberation that is not important to this issue at hand. What’s more interesting and not as widely spoken of is that Cohen admitted (in a convoluted manner)
                            that Trump did have a sexual encounter with Daniels.<sup>1</sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>This issue, rather surprisingly, has clear connections to what has become a seemingly norm in society, at least in populous college societies, today: hook up culture. TinderU, a new feature of the Tinder app (commonly seen as a
                            “hook up” app, although most use it to boost their egos) has increased the use among college students across the U.S.<sup>2</sup> Although roughly only ⅕ of Tinder users admit to using it for hooking up, cultural cues tell
                            me otherwise and that is not even mentioning the more promiscuous hook up app, Grindr. While it may be easy to point fingers at Trump for engaging in a casual sex encounter (please forget that he wrongly stole money and cheated
                            on his wife in the process), many of us college students have been engaging in these behaviors for quite some time and our attitudes towards hook up culture has largely remained static (excluding same-sex promiscuity).
                            <sup>3</sup></p>
                        <p><em>Making it Philosophical:</em> Forgetting where Trump got the money from and that he was married at the time of his encounter, there are still ethical issues to be dissected, especially from a Kantian perspective on the ethics
                            of casual sex. No matter which way one tries to spin it, it is evident that “there is a strong case to be made that CS&P [casual sex and promiscuity] necessarily objectify, and that even if they do not, they likely objectify”
                            each individual in the act.<sup>4</sup>The biggest problem to consider is if it is morally wrong to hook up with others. </p>
                        <p>For Kantians, the answer is yes, and their reasoning is that, in all (or at least most) cases of casual hook ups, it is inextricably linked to deception and or coercion and (almost always) objectification. Deception is defined
                            as what one would typically think it to be, a trick, lie, or even absence of truth to get what one desires (in this case, sex). Clearly, Trump had to engage in deception when he stole money to pay for the act and lie to his
                            wife about it. This is not typical of hook up culture. </p>
                        <p> What is more common is coercion, but it is harder to define. First, there are two types of coercion, occurrent and dispositional. In occurrent coercion, it bypasses consent entirely, as seen in cases of brutal rape. With dispositional
                            coercion, it can manifest in many ways, but boils down to the threat of harm and requires that the other party “consent” to the act. In general, under dispositional coercion, if the party refuses to participate in the “offer”
                            (it is really a threat), they will be harmed in some way. </p>
                        <p>In the Daniels-Trump scandal, ignoring the deception, it is interesting to point out what forms of coercion may have been present. Was Daniels coerced because of Trump’s status in society? Many would argue, yes. Because he was
                            in a position of power, and if Daniels refused, Trump implicitly (by his sheer nature of the position he is in) threatens Daniels with repercussions. Was Daniels simply coerced because she was being paid? Claiming “yes” is
                            a little more muddy, but a Kantian would generally agree on the definition that it is only coercion if they are in a ‘desperate’ situation where it should be expected that she be paid anyways, regardless of her performing the
                            act. This is easier to explain with an example:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>“Suppose that A is mired in quicksand and is slowly but surely approaching death. When B happens along, A cries out to B for assistance. All B needs to do is throw A a rope. B is quite willing to accommodate A, ‘provided you pay
                            me $100,000 over the next ten years.’ Is B making A an offer? Hardly! B, we must presume, stands under a moral obligation to come to the aid of a person in serious distress, at least whenever such assistance entails no significant
                            risk, sacrifice of time, and so forth. A is entitled to B’s assistance."
                            <sup>5</sup></blockquote>
                        <p>Clearly, the ‘offer’ that B claims it to be is really a threat, “Before B’s proposal, A legitimately expected assistance from B, ‘no strings attached.’ In attaching a very unwelcome string, B’s proposal effectively renders A worse
                            off. What B proposes, then, is not an offer of assistance. Rather, B threatens A with the withholding of something (assistance) that A is entitled to have from B. (For clarity, I don't think it is likely that Daniels was coerced
                            in this manner. She did not expect to get paid for doing nothing.)
                        </p>
                        <p>This may lead many to conclude that they are off the hook for engaging in hook up culture because Trump engaged in deception and (likely) coercion to engage in casual sex, that he is morally wrong for doing so. This is true, but
                            the biggest problem, and what happens with most, if not all, casual sex encounters is objectification4. What’s worse, is that this objectification is merely that, nothing else, in casual sex. It is at this point the argument
                            may then shift to “what is so wrong with objectifying others (using another simply as a tool to get pleasure)?”. In an ideal situation, both parties find it pleasurable. It may also be viewed as simple recreation, release,
                            or distraction. The problem with hook up culture though, is that this is simply not the case. Less than half of people who have engaged in one-night stands rated it as they “were glad they did it”, a positive experience.

                        <h3>Public Intellectual Assignment Write-up</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col s12 m10">
                        <p>For my Public Intellectual Assignment, I decided to engage with Hope Ruse, a strong- willed liberal friend of mine. She, in almost every sense of the word, belongs to and is an an advocate of the liberal party and its values. Part
                            of this, is a view that sex in society can be positive and “hooking up” is a great thing. This is not me putting words in her mouth. In fact, she can be quoted saying, “Everyone, or at least most people, want sex. Therefore,
                            if they are consenting, then how can that not be good?” I can see this argument. Sex is typically seen as a positive experience. Many movies and other works depict the losing of virginity as something as a coming of age. What
                            I find problematic and posed to Hope is that most of these encounters where the hook ups occur do not end up really improving the lives of the people engaging in the hookup. In fact, as I told Hope, most of these experiences
                            these people rate as being negative. There is significant evidence saying that people are not enjoying these experiences. She told me that she simply did not believe that. Was my evidence too weak? What had I done wrong? I
                            tried to emphasize that I am not trying to say no one should ever have sex. I am just trying to say that hook up culture has some strange effects that should be considered if one were to hook up. These facts themselves put
                            the actor in the situation to be more likely not to hookup (probably) but I could not understand why I was being met with such resistance. I brought up the additional point that, if most of these people are not enjoying their
                            experiences, then they probably engaged in an act that they most likely did not agree to during the encounter. The lack of communication is troubling and can coerce participants into things they normally would never had originally
                            agreed to. Hope was able to see this point, but she still held that these people were adults and she still did not understand why objectifying people is such a bad thing, especially when the act is mutual. This is something
                            I never really considered before. I think this is something also special to sex and hooking up alone. I cannot think of any other acts in which both parties seem to be using each other as objects in such a mutual way. Perhaps,
                            this is something that people in society simply are okay with, something they are willing to will to become a universal maxim. When I tried coming up with an answer to “What is so wrong with people objectifying others?” I could
                            muster anything but, “Well, Kantianism says that using people as mere objects is one of the most evil things one can do”. However, upon further reflection, I am not sure this statement captures what Kant really meant. In sex,
                            people often use each other as objects, that is simply as a fact. In this case, the people might not be using each other as mere objects, they pass the Kantian test. Another instance, two (or more) people use each other as
                            mere objects in the sex act. In the ideal situation (which is unlikely), they both enjoy it and mutually agreed to use each other this way. Is this “will”-able? Is this allowed to become a universal maxim? I am not sure. I
                            would like to say it already is, but something to me still does not feel right. All the work I did proving that hook-up culture is overall not a good idea still sits with me and I think it might be because this is (hookup culture),
                            a bad maxim that society allowed. If we live in a society like this, how, then, can we ever hope to change it? Do we even need to? I am unsure.
